# Dogtags

I built this app because I got tired of looking for my car and figuring out where I went the previous night, also I want to avoid parking in the "bad parts" of town. On a button click, dogtags will track your location and store it locally on your phone so that you can remember your legendary night, without the guess work. 

The end goal will allow people to leave reviews on parking spots because I never want to get my car smashed again for a pair of f*ckn prescription glasses.... Like really. I am so over it.

blockchain is the newest buzz these days. might decide to save the reviews on some framework. Heavans the limit.
